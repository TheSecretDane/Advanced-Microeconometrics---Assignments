\section{Empirical results}

The data consists of $N = 441$ French manufacturing firms over 12 years $(T=12)$ from 1968 to 1979, and is thus a panel data set with $NT = 5292$ observations. The data is balanced.  

We estimate the models using the methods outlined in Section \ref{sec:methodology}. The estimates along with robust standard errors are reported in Table \ref{tab:estimates}. Coefficient significance and sign are consistent between methods that is we find a positive partial effect on log deflated sales from increasing any of the inputs conditional on the unobserved heterogeneity, as one would except. With labor increases resulting in a factor $\approx 4.5$ and $\approx 8.7$ relative sales increase, in percent, respectively.

However, for the estimates to carry any meaning, at all, we must test whether assumptions \textbf{FE.1, FE.2} and \textbf{FD.1, FD.2} hold. 

Table X reports the results of all misspecification tests as described in the latter part of Section \ref{sec:methodology}.

For the FE model we find that the strict exogeneity assumption is broken in which the $\hat{\beta}_{FE}$ is inconsistent, while the FD model, blah blah. Both models exhibit autocorrelated errors of at least degree one, why we use robust standard errors - such that the asymptotic variance estimator is still consistent, though not efficient, allowing valid inference, provided the \textbf{FE(D).1, FE(D).2}.

Next we proceed to test the null hypothesis of constant returns to scale. From Table \ref{tab:wald}, we reject the null at the 1 \% significance level with a p-value of $\approx 0$. Thus, we conclude that the (Cobb-Douglas) production function does not exhibit constant returns to scale, for French manufacturing firms in the period 1968-1979.

In addition one might want to test whether the production function exhibits increasing or decreasing returns to scale. This can be done by testing the null hypothesis of $\beta_K + \beta_L \geq 1$ against the alternative of $\beta_K + \beta_L < 1$ (decreasing returns to scale) or vice versa for increasing returns to scale. Importantly we need to consider that the test includes the boundary i.e. $\beta_K + \beta_L = 1$ such that we cant draw a conclusion if the null is accepted, which is why the tests are read somewhat opposite of what one might expect. One might suspect that this particular sector exhibits increasing returns to scale, as firms in manufacturing often benefit from economies of scale, which indeed is the case as seen from Table \ref{tab:rts_tests}.
