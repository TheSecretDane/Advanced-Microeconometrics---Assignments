\section{Cobb-Douglas production with CRS}

In this assignment we want to test whether the Cobb-Douglas production function (CD) exhibits constant returns to scale (CRS) at a firm level using real data and panel data methods. The Cobb-Douglas production function is given by,
\begin{align*}
    F(K,L) = A K^{\beta_K} L^{\beta_L}
\end{align*}
where $K$ is capital, $L$ is labor, $A$ is total factor productivity (TFP) and $\beta_K, \beta_L$ are the output elasticities of capital and labor, respectively.
It follows that for CD to have CRS, it must be homogeneous of degree one, i.e. $\beta_K + \beta_L = 1$, as seen from,
\begin{align*}
    F(\lambda K, \lambda L) &= A (\lambda K)^{\beta_K} (\lambda L)^{\beta_L} = A \lambda^{\beta_K + \beta_L} K^{\beta_K} L^{\beta_L} = \lambda F(K,L) \iff \beta_K + \beta_L = 1.
\end{align*} 
which forms the linear hypothesis we want to test i.e. $H_0: \beta_K + \beta_L = 1$ vs. $H_A: \beta_K + \beta_L \neq 1$.
While $K$ and $L$ are certainly important production inputs, we cannot hope to observe \textbf{all} input factors that make up production. To investigate the functional form of the production function, we estimate a simple (two-way) fixed effects (FE) model, to remove the time-invarying and time-varying unobserved heterogeneity. Note, that these factors with control for much more than just TFP, but also other unobserved factors that may affect production. 

\hrule

We start by taking logs of the production function to linearize it and add an idiosyncratic error term, $\varepsilon_{it}$, to get,
\begin{align*}
    \ln Y_{it} &= \ln A_{it} + \beta_K \ln K_{it} + \beta_L \ln L_{it} + \varepsilon_{it} \\
    y_{it} &= \beta_K k_{it} + \beta_L l_{it} + u_{it}, \quad u_{it} = \ln A_{it}
\end{align*}
Suppose that $\ln A_{it}$ can be decomposed into a time-invariant firm-specific effect, $\alpha_i$, a time-varying effect, $\gamma_t$, and add an idiosyncratic error, $\varepsilon_{it}$, i.e. $u_{it} = \alpha_i + \gamma_t + \varepsilon_{it}$. The FE model is then given by,
\begin{align*}
    u_{it} &= \alpha_i + \gamma_t + \varepsilon_{it}, \\
    y_{it} &= \alpha_i + \gamma_t + \beta_K k_{it} + \beta_L l_{it} + \varepsilon_{it},
\end{align*} 
where $y_{it} = \ln Y_{it}$, $k_{it} = \ln K_{it}$ and $l_{it} = \ln L_{it}$. 

\textbf{Gameplan:}

Write stuff about assumptions, and then transformations, prob go from inconsistent pooled OLS to consistent FE. Right the estimator, list assumptions for identification and consistency (strict/cont exog, non-generacy) -> show consistency by LLN convergence in plim. Next, talk about asymptotic normality, CLT, variance estimation (efficiency - robust, cluster). Finally, hypothesis testing (Wald). Then proceed to empirical application (include wald-test code, since it is not given or done in any exercises).

\begin{itemize}
    \item Mikkel: Requirements for FE and why pooled OLS is inconsistent (identification, assumptions, consistency, exogeneity). 
    \item Mikkel: Show consistency (LLN $\to$ plim convergence). 
    \item Mikkel: Show Asymptotic normality.
    \item Mathias: Show Efficiency (Robust or not).
    \item Noah: Seriel Corr, Rank test, Homoskedasticity (maybe). 
    \item Noah: Wald-Test (one sided as well)? Check form of test when using robust std. err. 
    \item Mathias: Potentially the above, for time variant fixed effects.
    \item Noah: Present empirical results. 
    \item Noah: Estimation table. 
    \item Noah: Misspecification test table.
    \item Noah: Test table for linear hypothesis (Wald).
