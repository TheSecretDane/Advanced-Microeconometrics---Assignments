\section{Discussion and conclusion}

Inconsitent estimators.... 

Cobb-Douglas assumed to be the functional form of production, assumes elasticity of substitution of 1. One could conduct a similar test, though it might be much more involved, say for a non-CRS CES production function. Human capital? Land? 

Cluster / Driscroll Kraay / any more appropriate Avar estimator that takes into account the panel structure. GLS for modelling structurally induced autocorrelation.  

Omitted variables ? - Time dummies -\> plausible to assume that there are common TFP components for French manufacturing firms that are constant over time.
